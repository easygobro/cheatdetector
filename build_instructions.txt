CheatDetector Mod Build Instructions
=====================================

Since we couldn't build the JAR file directly, here's how to build it on your system:

1. Install JDK 17 and Gradle if you don't have them already

2. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the CheatDetector directory

3. Run the following commands:
   ```
   gradle wrapper
   ./gradlew build
   ```
   (On Windows use `gradlew.bat build` instead)

4. The compiled JAR file will be located at:
   `build/libs/cheatdetector-1.0.0.jar`

5. Copy this JAR file to your Fabric server's `mods` folder

6. Make sure you have Fabric API installed in your server's `mods` folder
   (Download it from https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)

7. Start/restart your server

Testing Commands
---------------
Once the server is running with the mod installed, you can use these commands:

- `/cd help` - Shows all available commands
- `/testspeed` - Simulates a speed hack to test detection
- `/testfly` - Simulates a flight hack to test detection

Note: You need to be an operator to use these commands.
